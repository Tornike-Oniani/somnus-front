            “Knowledge Based Partnership for Development of Sleep Medicine Research Platform and Promotion of Sleep science in Georgia"

          <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Summary</h3>
        
          <p class="paragraph">
            The large body of knowledge and major developments in sleep science over the past 30 years clearly documented that healthy sleep dramatically influences human well being, safety and quality of life.
          </p>
        
          <p class="paragraph">
            Progress in development of human sleep research and sleep medicine in Georgia is slow. On the other hand, the number of people suffering from sleep disturbances is progressively rising. Accordingly, the initiation of sleep disorders’ assessment, evaluation and management program is obviously required. In order to respond to this demand, development of sleep medicine research platform, as a basis for strengthening the field of sleep medicine, should be identified as of particular interest to lifelong health and well-being, and to promotion of sleep science in Georgia. With an excellent track record of basic sleep research in Georgia carried out by members of T.Oniani Laboratory of Sleep-Wakefulness Studies, Ilia State University (ISU), Tbilisi, Georgia, it seems appropriate that this Laboratory takes a leading role in recognizing the significance of sleep medicine and in promoting fruitful cooperation between sleep science and sleep medicine in Georgia. The partnership instituted with a team of Swiss professionals (Sleep Laboratory, University Hospital of Geneva, Chêne-Bourg, Genève) highly experienced in clinical aspects of sleep science, would be a major tool for achieving this long-term goal.
          </p>
        
          <p class="paragraph">
            The main objectives of the proposed Institutional Partnership are to: (1) modernize infrastructure of the Laboratory; (2) gain human sleep research related skills and expand human sleep research capabilities; (3) launch sleep medicine research platform and strengthen sleep medicine development in Georgia; (4) initiate public awareness campaign about the importance of sleep; (5) stimulate interdisciplinary approach to sleep disorders; (6) convert the research outcomes into health and social advantages, and (7) envisage long-term partnership with the Swiss Sleep Laboratory. Importantly, the proposed program perfectly fits within ISU’s broader strategic vision and the importance of partnership with the Universities worldwide.
          </p>
        
          <p class="paragraph">
            The partnership and knowledge transfer among the Swiss and Georgian colleagues would be an opportunity for successful combination of clinical and basic aspects of sleep science and for development of sleep medicine research platform that match international standards in the field. This partnership would be beneficial not only in terms of addressing problems of sleep medicine development at the national context, but will also be an attempt to reduce the number of pressing research questions related to sleep disorders at the global context.
